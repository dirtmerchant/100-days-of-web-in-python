# Day 49 Selenium

As we have only one day for this miscellaneous topic, watching the videos should suffice.

In this lesson we will test [PyBites My Reading List](https://pbreadinglist.herokuapp.com/) Django app.

If you want to follow along with my code, consider [creating an account](http://pbreadinglist.herokuapp.com/accounts/register/) and setting your username and password in your virtual environment's activation script:

	$ vi venv/bin/activate
	...
	export USERNAME='your_user'
	export PASSWORD='your_password'

The starter code can be found in the [start subdirectory](start), the final code is [here](final).
